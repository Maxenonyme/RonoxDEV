# Hi, I'm Maxenonyme 👋

### 🔬 Independent AI Researcher | Specialist in Grokking & Subtractive Architectures
I specialize in discovering "Invisible Rules" within neural networks. My work focuses on **Mechanistic Interpretability** and **Neuro-Symbolic architectures**, moving away from massive data dependency to focus on pure logical emergence.

---

### 🚀 Major Projects
* **C.L.E.A.R. Framework:** A subtractive AI architecture that extracts minimal logical kernels (Diamants Logiques) through high-pressure weight decay. 
* **Axiomatic Duality:** My research on the "Quantum Unifier," demonstrating how minimalist networks can resolve direct logical paradoxes by discovering latent wave-functions.
* **OpenAura Search:** Implementing advanced search and logic-driven retrieval systems.

### 🧠 Research Areas
* **Grokking & Phase Transitions:** Studying the sudden shift from memorization to algorithmic understanding.
* **Subtractive Intelligence:** Developing the "Sieve" (Passoire) methodology to eliminate statistical noise in favor of pure logic.
* **Logic Transplantation:** Grafting independent reasoning kernels into universal master cores.

## 💎 The C.L.E.A.R. White Paper is now available!
Following the recent validation by **Grok (xAI)**, I am officially releasing the technical white paper for the C.L.E.A.R. architecture. This document formalizes the **Logic Sieve** methodology and the emergence of periodic kernels."


**What's inside:** * **The Mathematical Foundation:** Formalization of the subtractive pressure and the $J(\theta)$ objective function. * 
**Axiomatic Duality Resolution:** How a minimalist MLP discovers a latent wave-function $\Psi(x) \approx \sin(\omega x + \phi)$ to resolve logical paradoxes. * 
**Empirical Proofs:** Visual evidence of geometric emergence in Modulo 97 (Figure 2) and Mirror Logic (Figure 3).

Special thanks to the AI research community for the feedback. Let's build a truly interpretable, neuro-symbolic future.
